# Optim4Life project

In the IBM Decision Optimization team, we develop optimization engines, tools and platforms. 
We ourselves donâ€™t develop ready-to-use final solutions, but our tools can be used to directly solve real-life problems. 
Our technology is already used in many day-to-day critical applications, from nationwide energy production and consumption balances, to large food supply chain design and operations. 
Before having to work almost 24 hours a day, many nurses in many hospitals had their schedules built with solutions embedding our technology. 
To create the solution which answers these complex problems, our customers use our tools and platforms to develop and deploy Decision Optimization models, which they embed in their applications.
